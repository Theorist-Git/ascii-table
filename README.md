# Simple ASCII Table

This website is an adaptation of an [ASCII table page from cs.cmu.edu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html), which was itself an adaptation of an [older page from members.tripod.com](http://members.tripod.com/~plangford/ascii.html).

Both of the original sources have since gone down.

I really liked the convenience these simple look-up tables provided: **no ads, no animations**. You can just click the link in your shortcut, see what you wanted to see, and close. This project preserves that simple, fast experience.
